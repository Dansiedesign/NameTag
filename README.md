Which web event did you hook into to update the display name?
I added an alert funtion to greet the user.

Where in your HTML did you link to your JavaScript file? Are there better places? What's the best place? 
I linked it at the top so it would load with the page. The location is dependent of where you want it to load or where your javascript is used in the page. 

Why is it best practice to store your CSS/JS in external files rather than in your HTML file? 
It is a good practice to do to organize each element in the project. Doing it all in the HTML file may slow down load times and possibly interact with different elements that may be unrelated to what you are trying to work on.
